# Implementation Notes

## Missing Features Implemented

This document summarizes the implementation of the missing features in the Java PostgreSQL client project.

### 1. Transaction Management

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented

#### Features Added:
- Transaction state tracking with `inTransaction` field
- Visual indicator in prompt (asterisk `*`) when in a transaction
- Meta-commands for transaction control:
  - `\begin` - Start a transaction
  - `\commit` - Commit the current transaction
  - `\rollback` - Rollback the current transaction
  - `\savepoint [name]` - Create a savepoint
  - `\release [name]` - Release a savepoint
- SQL command interception for BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
- Automatic rollback of active transactions during cleanup
- Transaction state reset on new connections

#### Implementation Details:
- Modified prompt generation to show transaction status
- Added dedicated handler methods for each transaction operation
- Updated help text to include transaction commands
- Enhanced cleanup method to handle active transactions properly

### 2. Advanced Command Completion

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented

#### Features Added:
- Context-aware SQL completion with database metadata
- Table name completion after FROM, JOIN, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
- Column name completion after SELECT, WHERE, SET, etc.
- Schema-aware completion (schema.table format)
- Function name completion (system and user-defined)
- Caching of database metadata with 1-minute timeout
- Dynamic completer upgrade when connection is established
- Completer updates when switching databases

#### Implementation Details:
- Created new `AdvancedSqlCompleter` class
- Implements intelligent context detection using regex patterns
- Caches schemas, tables, columns, and functions from database metadata
- Supports table aliases and schema prefixes
- Automatically refreshes cache every minute
- Integrates seamlessly with existing completion infrastructure

#### Key Classes:
- `AdvancedSqlCompleter.java` - Main implementation of context-aware completion
- Pattern matching for SQL contexts (FROM, SELECT, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Metadata caching with ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety
- Support for both basic keyword completion and advanced database object completion

### Integration Notes:
- The LineReader starts with basic `SqlCompleter` during initialization
- Upon successful database connection, it upgrades to `AdvancedSqlCompleter`
- Uses cast to `LineReaderImpl` to dynamically change the completer
- Completer is updated when switching connections via `\connect`

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Test transaction commands with various SQL operations
2. Verify transaction state persists across multiple commands
3. Test completion in different SQL contexts
4. Verify metadata cache updates when database schema changes
5. Test completer behavior when switching between databases
